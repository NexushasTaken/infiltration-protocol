# 🎮 Infiltration Protocol: The Infiltration

## Scene 1 — Mission Briefing (HQ, Night)

**Leader:** "Agent, our company’s main data was stolen and hidden inside CoreData Tower’s database.
Your mission: infiltrate the building, retrieve the master data, delete all copies, and escape undetected."

**You:** "Retrieve, delete, escape. Got it."

**Ava (Tech Support):** "I’ll guide you from here. Don’t run unknown code inside their system — it could be a trap."

**Leader:** "We trust your skills. Good luck, Agent."

## Scene 2 — Arrival at CoreData Tower

(You arrive outside a massive futuristic skyscraper.)

**You:** "Security drones, cameras, laser grids. Perfect welcome."

**Ava:** "I’m looping the camera feed for 30 seconds. Move to the service gate now!"

(You slip through the gate just before the loop resets.)

---

## Scene 3 — Inside the Air Ducts

(You crawl quietly through a vent, listening to guards below.)

**Guard 1:** "The backup server runs at 2 A.M. Don’t touch Mirror-3 or the system crashes."

**Guard 2:** "Yeah, that mirror replicates everything."

**You (whisper):** "Noted. Avoid Mirror-3."

**Ava:** "Good catch. That’s your biggest threat during deletion."

---

## Scene 4 — The Locked Door

(A keypad glows with numbers in binary: `1011`.)

**You:** "Binary for eleven. Let’s try that."

(Door unlocks.)

**Ava:** "Nice. Keep moving. You’re close to the server wing."

---

## Scene 5 — Server Wing Access

**System Prompt:**
"Authentication Required. Send Key?"

**You:** "Let’s not send plaintext. I’ll encrypt with an HMAC — safe handshake."

(You type the command. The gate opens.)

**Ava:** "Access granted. You have five minutes before the system refreshes."

---

## Scene 6 — Database Center

(Rows of glowing servers stretch endlessly.)

**You:** "Found the database. Master file and multiple copies."

**Ava:** "Download the master file safely. Don’t execute it — sandbox it."

(You download the master data.)

**Ava:** "Checksum confirmed. No corruption."

**You:** "Now for the copies."

---

## Scene 7 — The Deletion

**You:** "If I delete directly, the system will create backups. I’ll lock the table and delete everything at once."

**Ava:** "Deletion complete. No replication detected."

**You:** "Good. Data’s clean."

---

## Scene 8 — The Alarm

(A red light flashes.)

**You:** "Someone noticed something."

**Ava:** "I’m delaying their alert system. Move now! Exit through the maintenance tunnel."

**You:** "On it!"

(You run through dark tunnels, climbing ladders and avoiding guards.)

---

## Scene 9 — Escape

(You emerge outside the tower as the rain falls.)

**Ava:** "Drone sensors are offline. You’re clear."

**You:** "Mission complete. Heading home."

---

## Scene 10 — Back at HQ

**Leader:** "Excellent work. The stolen data is secured, and all copies are gone."

**Ava:** "But the data had strange self-learning code. It might not be over yet."

**You:** "Then we’ll be ready when it returns."

(Screen fades. **Mission: SUCCESS.**)
